**Inventory Alpha** is a microeconomic diagnostic platform designed to identify "Phantom Demand" and "Dead Inventory" using advanced state estimation techniques. By applying a **Kalman Filter** to noisy sales data, the system extracts the true underlying demand signal, allowing for radical inventory reduction without compromising service levels.

## 🚀 Key Value Proposition
*   **Detect Phantom Demand:** Separate random noise from actual demand trends.
*   **Reduce Dead Inventory:** Identify overstocked SKUs that tie up capital.
*   **Dynamic Safety Stock:** Calculate safety levels based on real-time signal uncertainty rather than static historical variance.
*   **Increase Capital Efficiency:** Optimized stock levels lead to better cash flow.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Methodology
The project was developed in a 5-sprint agile cycle:

1.  **Sprint 1: Infrastructure & Ingestion** - Scalable data loading using Polars and the M5 Forecasting dataset.
2.  **Sprint 2: Signal Processing** - Pre-processing filters to handle out-of-stock zeros and outliers.
3.  **Sprint 3: State Estimation** - Implementation of a Recursive Kalman Filter to estimate latent demand.
4.  **Sprint 4: Inventory Logic** - Dynamic safety stock and "Alpha" (excess) calculation logic.
5.  **Sprint 5: Visualization** - Interactive dashboard for real-time SKU diagnostics.

### The Kalman Advantage
Traditional inventory models often use simple moving averages or exponential smoothing. Inventory Alpha uses a custom **Recursive Kalman Filter**, which:
- Accounts for **Measurement Noise ($R$)**: Random sales fluctuations and measurement errors.
- Accounts for **Process Uncertainty ($Q$)**: How fast the underlying demand signal actually changes.
- Provides a **Dynamic Covariance ($P$)**: Used directly to calculate Z-score based safety stock buffers.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexxlevesque/inventoryalpha.git
cd inventoryalpha
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
```bash
poetry install
```
Alternatively, using `pip`:
```bash
pip install polars numpy scipy streamlit matplotlib plotly
```

### 3. Data Setup
Ensure the **M5 Forecasting Accuracy** dataset (available on Kaggle) is placed in the project root directory:
- `sales_train_evaluation.csv`
- `sell_prices.csv`
- `calendar.csv`

### 4. Run the Dashboard
```bash
poetry run streamlit run src/app.py
```

## 📊 Diagnostic Insights
The platform provides three main analytical views:
1.  **Demand & Inventory Tracking:** A 90-day lookback comparing actual sales to the Kalman-estimated "True Demand" signal with 95% confidence bands.
2.  **Demand Probabilities:** A probability density function (PDF) showing the distribution of demand over the replenishment lead time.
3.  **Inventory Snapshot:** A breakdown of current stock vs. Target Inventory (Cycle Stock + Safety Stock).
